Phishing website detection system provides strong security mechanism to detect and prevent phishing domains from reaching user. This project presents a simple and portable approach to detect spoofed webpages and solve security vulnerabilities using Machine Learning. 


PYTHON DEPENDENCIES:

   • NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn: For Data cleaning, Data analysis and Data modelling.

   • Pickle: For exporting the model to local machine


FUTURE SCOPE:
The model can be deployed to a website using Flask hence making it easier to be operated by anyone since all the major tasks are happening in the backend. The user will provide URL as input to the GUI and click on submit button. The output will show “PHISHING” for phishing URL and “LEGITIMATE” for not phished URL.
